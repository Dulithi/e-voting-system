### Cryptography (crypto_service.dart)

#### ‚úÖ Implemented Algorithms

1. **RSA-2048**
   - Key pair generation
   - Sign/Verify operations
   - Blind message operations
   - Unblind signature operations
   - **Use case**: Blind signatures for anonymous voting tokens

2. **X25519 (Curve25519)**
   - Key pair generation for ECDH
   - Key agreement protocol
   - **Use case**: ECIES encryption foundation

3. **AES-256-GCM**
   - Encryption with authentication
   - Decryption with tag verification
   - **Use case**: Symmetric encryption in ECIES

4. **ECIES (Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme)**
   - Full encrypt/decrypt implementation
   - Ephemeral key generation
   - **Use case**: End-to-end vote encryption

5. **SHA-256**
   - Hashing operations
   - **Use case**: Vote hash, receipt hash, proofs

6. **HKDF (HMAC-based Key Derivation Function)**
   - Key derivation from shared secrets
   - **Use case**: Deriving encryption keys in ECIES

7. **Vote-Specific Functions**
   - `encryptVote()` - Encrypts candidate selection with ECIES
   - `createVoteReceipt()` - Generates verifiable receipt
   - Both include timestamps and cryptographic commitments

### State Management (Providers)

#### auth_provider.dart
- User registration
- User login
- Session management (JWT tokens)
- Automatic key generation (X25519 keypair)
- User profile fetching
- Logout

#### election_provider.dart
- Fetch all elections
- Fetch single election with candidates
- Submit encrypted vote
- Generate vote receipt
- Track vote status (prevent double voting)
- Filter active vs past elections

### Storage (storage_service.dart)

- Access tokens (JWT)
- Refresh tokens
- Private keys (X25519)
- Public keys
- User data

#### Regular Storage (Shared Preferences)

- Routing based on auth status

#### 2. Login Screen
- Email/password form
- Form validation
- Error handling
- Link to registration

#### 3. Register Screen
- Full name, NIC, email, DOB, phone, password
- Date picker for DOB
- Form validation
- Automatic key generation on success

#### 4. Home Screen

### API Integration (api_service.dart)

#### Auth Endpoints
- `POST /auth/register` - Register new user
- `POST /auth/login` - Login user
- `GET /auth/me` - Get current user
- `POST /auth/refresh` - Refresh access token

#### Election Endpoints
- `GET /election/list` - Get all elections
- `GET /election/{id}` - Get single election with candidates

#### Vote Endpoints
- `POST /vote/submit` - Submit encrypted vote
- `GET /vote/status/{election_id}` - Check vote status

#### Token Endpoints (Ready)
- `POST /token/request` - Request blind signature

### Security Features

#### End-to-End Encryption
1. User generates X25519 keypair on first login
2. Private key stored in Secure Storage (Keychain on iOS)
3. Vote encrypted with ECIES using user's public key
4. Server receives ciphertext + ephemeral public key + nonce + tag
5. Only user can decrypt (but won't need to - threshold trustees decrypt aggregate)

#### Anonymous Voting (Infrastructure Ready)
1. Blind signature protocol implemented
2. User blinds identity
3. Server signs without seeing identity
4. User unblinds to get anonymous token
5. Token used to vote (breaks link between identity and ballot)

#### Vote Receipt
1. Cryptographic hash of encrypted vote
2. Receipt ID for tracking
3. Receipt hash for verification
4. QR code for easy scanning
5. Can verify on public bulletin board (future)

#### Key Storage
- Private keys never leave device
- Secure Storage uses:
  - **iOS**: Keychain with kSecAttrAccessibleWhenUnlocked
  - **Android**: EncryptedSharedPreferences with AES-256-GCM

#### Authentication
- JWT tokens with 15-minute expiry
- Refresh token with 7-day expiry
- Automatic refresh on 401 errors
- Secure token storage

## üéØ How to Test Cryptography

### Test 1: Key Generation
```dart
final crypto = CryptoService();
final keys = crypto.generateX25519KeyPair();
print('Private: ${crypto.base64Encode(keys['private_key']!)}');
print('Public: ${crypto.base64Encode(keys['public_key']!)}');
```

### Test 2: Vote Encryption
```dart
final votePackage = crypto.encryptVote(
  candidateId: 1,
  electionId: 'test-election-123',
  voterPublicKey: publicKeyBytes,
);
print('Encrypted vote package:');
print(votePackage);
```

### Test 3: ECIES Round-Trip
```dart
// Generate recipient keys
final recipientKeys = crypto.generateX25519KeyPair();

// Encrypt
final plaintext = 'My secret vote for Candidate 1';
final encrypted = crypto.eciesEncrypt(
  recipientKeys['public_key']!,
  Uint8List.fromList(utf8.encode(plaintext)),
);

// Decrypt
final decrypted = crypto.eciesDecrypt(
  privateKey: recipientKeys['private_key']!,
  ephemeralPublicKey: encrypted['ephemeral_public_key']!,
  ciphertext: encrypted['ciphertext']!,
  nonce: encrypted['nonce']!,
  tag: encrypted['tag']!,
);

print('Original: $plaintext');
print('Decrypted: ${utf8.decode(decrypted)}');
assert(plaintext == utf8.decode(decrypted));
```

### Test 4: Receipt Generation
```dart
final receipt = crypto.createVoteReceipt(
  electionId: 'test-election-123',
  candidateId: 1,
  voteHash: 'abc123def456...',
);
print('Receipt ID: ${receipt['receipt_id']}');
print('Receipt Hash: ${receipt['receipt_hash']}');
```

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Testing on iPhone (from Windows)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Note
**You CANNOT deploy to iPhone directly from Windows.** You need macOS.

### Option 1: Use Android Instead (Recommended)
1. Install Android Studio
2. Create Android Emulator (Pixel 6 Pro, API 34)
3. Run: `flutter run`
4. Test all features on Android

### Option 2: Use Remote Mac
1. Rent cloud Mac (MacStadium, MacinCloud)
2. Transfer project files
3. Follow iOS deployment in DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md

### Option 3: Borrow Mac from Friend
1. Install Xcode on their Mac
2. Transfer project
3. Deploy to iPhone
4. iPhone stays connected to your backend

### Testing Flow (Once Deployed)

#### Step 1: Update API URL
```dart
// lib/services/api_service.dart line 8
static const String baseUrl = 'http://192.168.1.100'; // Your Windows PC IP
```

#### Step 2: Start Backend Services
```powershell
# Terminal 1-4: Start auth, election, vote, token services
# Use --host 0.0.0.0 to allow external connections
```

#### Step 3: Configure Firewall
```powershell
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "FastAPI Services" -Direction Inbound -LocalPort 8001-8006 -Protocol TCP -Action Allow
```

#### Step 4: Ensure Same Network
- iPhone/Android device on same WiFi as Windows PC
- No VPN active
- Router not blocking inter-device communication

#### Step 5: Test Connection
From phone browser: `http://YOUR_IP:8001/docs`
Should see FastAPI docs.

#### Step 6: Run App
- Open app
- Register new user
- Login
- View elections
- Cast vote
- View receipt
